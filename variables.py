"""Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.


Creating Variables 
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


nameOfVariables = dataVaulue



Output Variables
The Python print() function is often used to output variables.

In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:

You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
"""
# personsName = "kofi"
# print(personsName)


# bin  = "trash"
# print(bin)


# hisName  = "kofi"
# herName = "Ama"

# print(hisName)
# print(herName)

# friut_ = "banana"


# three ways of naming in programming 
# word like hello world


# camel casing  --->  helloWorld --variables
# snake casing --->  hello_world -- functions
# pascal casing --->  HelloWorld -- class


# lets create some variables

# myAge = 90
# school = "openlabs Ghana"

# # myAge,school =90,"openlabs Ghana" 

# print(myAge,school)


# x = "Python "
# y = "is "
# z = "awesome" 
# print(x + y + z )


# examples
# 1.Create a variable named carname and assign the value Volvo to it.

# carName = "Volvo"
# print(carName)


# 2.Create a variable named x and assign the value 50 to it.
# x = 50
# print(x)

# 3.Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables: x and y.

# x=5,
# y=10
# sum = x+y

# print(sum)


# 4.Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result.

# x = 5
# y = 10

# z = x+y
# print(z)


#5. Remove the illegal characters in the variable name:
# 2my-first_name = "John"

# myFirstname = "John"
# print(myFirstname)
